Advent of Code 2018
===================

This is a collection of my solutions of puzzles from Advent of Code 2018
(https://adventofcode.com/2018) written in Python 3. I'm not very proficient
in Python and I hope this will be good oportunity to learn something new in
Python, discover further interesting modules and have a fun as in Advent of
Code 2017 last year:)
